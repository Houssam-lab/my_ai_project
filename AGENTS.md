# CogniForge Agents & Architecture Directives

## Philosophy: The Dual Heritage

This project adopts a fusion of two computer science methodologies. All code and architectural decisions must reflect this synthesis.

### 1. The Harvard Standard (CS50 2025)

*   **Strictest Typing:** No `Any`. Use `type | None` instead of `Optional`. Use generic collections (`list[str]`) not `List[str]`.
*   **Clarity:** Code must be understandable by a beginner but robust enough for an enterprise.
*   **Documentation:** Professional Arabic Docstrings are mandatory for all core components.
*   **Explicit is Better than Implicit:** Fail fast. Import explicitly.

### 2. The Berkeley Standard (SICP / CS61A)

*   **Abstraction Barriers:** Strictly separate implementation details from usage. A change in a lower-level library should not force a rewrite of high-level logic.
*   **Functional Core, Imperative Shell:** Prefer pure functions. Push side effects (I/O, DB) to the boundaries.
*   **Composition over Inheritance:** Build complex behaviors by composing simple functions or objects, not by deep class hierarchies.
*   **Data as Code:** Configuration should be declarative (data structures), interpreted by the system, rather than hard-coded logic steps.

## Unified Agent Context — Mandatory Boot Contract (D-275)

Before planning, coding, researching, or changing any project asset, every agent MUST load [`docs/governance/AGENT_CONTEXT_REGISTRY.json`](docs/governance/AGENT_CONTEXT_REGISTRY.json) and follow its authority order and boot sequence. The registry connects the product mission, constitutions, runtime truth, reference backbone, commercial offer catalog, architecture, education goals, governance, and evidence rules.

For documentation changes, the additional canonical contract is [`docs/DOCUMENTATION_CONTRACT.md`](docs/DOCUMENTATION_CONTRACT.md), and its machine-readable scope is [`docs/DOCUMENTATION_MANIFEST.json`](docs/DOCUMENTATION_MANIFEST.json). A documentation change is not mergeable if the documentation contract gate fails. Agents must not weaken, skip, or convert that gate to a warning.

An agent MUST distinguish law from status, proposal from proof, and reference material from implemented capability. It MUST trace each substantive task to a user/customer problem, a project capability, a relevant evidence source, and—when the work is commercial—a declared hard-currency revenue path. It MUST not invent metrics, customer validation, security claims, revenue, or runtime status.

The default change policy is additive: do not delete, rename, replace, or silently supersede existing project assets. If a change is architectural, commercial, security-sensitive, or difficult to reverse, create an ADR and preserve the previous record. Before reporting completion, run the relevant gates, inspect `git diff --check`, and verify that no unintended deletions occurred.

Canonical context law: [`docs/architecture/AGENT_CONTEXT_CONSTITUTION.md`](docs/architecture/AGENT_CONTEXT_CONSTITUTION.md). Current context status: [`.memory/agent_context_truth.md`](.memory/agent_context_truth.md).

## Governing Product Decision (D-300) — Read Before Planning Any Work

The owner's written decision **D-300 (2026-09-29, recorded in [`.memory/decisions.md`](.memory/decisions.md))** selects **one active product thesis**: `fr-be-einvoicing-referential-cleansing` — a manually delivered service that cleanses French and Belgian e-invoicing third-party referentials using `tools/hard_currency_engine` (`france` · `belgium` · `crm`). Its consequences bind every agent:

* **The educational platform (`app/` + `microservices/` + `frontend/`) is FROZEN.** No features, no service migration, no model-chain work, no table-ownership convergence. The only permitted engineering work is what serves the wedge (tool health) and what keeps CI honest.
* **`naas_verifier` is FROZEN as EXPERIMENTAL** until a buyer asks a third-party agent to read it; its gates (`GATE_0/A/B/C`) stay `ABSENT` and forbid superiority/moat/PMF claims.
* **Commercial truth is append-only** in `docs/commercial/outreach/CONTACT_LEDGER.csv`; the scorecard is derived from it and never hand-written. New research or offer documents require a new outbound-contact row in the same diff (`check_outbound_before_research` gate, D-297).
* **No offer's readiness state may be promoted** (PROPOSED → DISCOVERY → … → PAID_PROOF → REPEATABLE) without verifiable evidence — a settled transaction, not interest, meetings, or benchmarks.

An agent that plans platform feature work, service decomposition, or new product theses without a written owner decision lifting the freeze is violating the constitution, not exercising initiative.

Before adding or modifying code, the agent MUST also load [`docs/architecture/CODE_ACCEPTANCE_CONSTITUTION.md`](docs/architecture/CODE_ACCEPTANCE_CONSTITUTION.md), [`docs/research/EVIDENCE_CATALOG.json`](docs/research/EVIDENCE_CATALOG.json), [`docs/research/UNIVERSITY_CURRICULUM_CATALOG.json`](docs/research/UNIVERSITY_CURRICULUM_CATALOG.json), [`docs/research/CURRICULUM_APPLICATION_MATRIX.json`](docs/research/CURRICULUM_APPLICATION_MATRIX.json), and the current change packet [`docs/changes/CURRENT_CODE_ACCEPTANCE_PACKET.json`](docs/changes/CURRENT_CODE_ACCEPTANCE_PACKET.json). The packet must account for every catalogued course, then state which domains apply to the task and why. A code change without standards, academic consideration, evidence, local application, production proof, commercial trace, and an explicit zero-deletion check is not mergeable.

## API-First Microservice Architecture (The Constitution)

The system is mandated to be **100% API First Microservice**.
All agents and developers must strictly adhere to the **100 Laws of Microservices** defined in the Constitution.

**Canonical document:** [`docs/architecture/MICROSERVICES_CONSTITUTION.md`](docs/architecture/MICROSERVICES_CONSTITUTION.md) — 100 laws, Arabic. This is the authoritative source.
**English summary:** [`docs/ARCH_MICROSERVICES_CONSTITUTION.md`](docs/ARCH_MICROSERVICES_CONSTITUTION.md) — read-only reference; do not edit independently. When the canonical changes, update the summary in the same PR. Do not create a third copy.

### Critical Laws Summary

1.  **Independence:** Each service is an island. Own DB, own deployment, own codebase.
2.  **API Communication:** Services speak ONLY via HTTP/gRPC or Async Events. No direct DB access to another service's data.
3.  **Polyglot & Containerized:** Use the best tool for the job, isolated in Docker.
4.  **Zero Trust:** Authenticate everything.
5.  **No Shared Libraries (Logic):** Do not share business logic libraries. Duplicate code if necessary to preserve independence (Rule 97/98).

---

## Coding Rules

### A. The Reality Kernel (System Root)

The `app/kernel.py` and `app/core` must act as the **Evaluator** of the system.
*   **Initialization:** Treat application startup as a functional pipeline: `Config -> AppState -> WeavedApp`.
*   **Middleware & Routes:** Define them as data (lists/registries) and "apply" them using higher-order functions.

### B. The Overmind (Cognitive Engine)

*   **State:** Use explicit State passing (like the `CollaborationContext` protocol) rather than global variables or singletons.
*   **Recursion:** Use tree recursion for planning and task decomposition where appropriate.

### C. Language & Style

*   **Docstrings:** Must be in **Professional Arabic**.
    *   *Example:* `"""يقوم هذا التابع بحساب المجموع التراكمي..."""`
*   **Type Hints:** Python 3.12+ Syntax.
    *   Use `def fn(x: int | float) -> list[str]:`
    *   Do NOT use `typing.Union`, `typing.List`.
*   **Imports:** Clean, sorted, and explicit.

### D. Global Singletons (Controlled Exception)

The codebase uses `global` for lazy-initialised service singletons (e.g., `_unified_observability`, `_mcp_server`). `PLW0603` is suppressed in `pyproject.toml` to allow this pattern.

New code should prefer dependency injection via FastAPI `Depends`. Only use `global` when a singleton cannot be injected — for example, a background worker initialised at startup. Always document the reason with a comment:

```python
# Singleton: initialised once at startup, injected via get_service() dependency elsewhere.
_service_instance: MyService | None = None
```

## Repository Layout Contract

| Artefact | Canonical location |
|----------|--------------------|
| New microservice | `microservices/<service_name>/` |
| Microservice in a non-Python language (ADR-006) | `microservices/<service_name>/` — same folder, same contract. The gates inspect OpenAPI + `/health` + `/metrics`, never the language. Adoption conditions: `docs/architecture/EXTENSION_SEAMS.md` §7 |
| Canonical data shared by monolith + a service | `shared/<domain>/` + a vendored copy in the service, proven equal by a parity gate (no shared business-logic library — Constitution 97/98) |
| Shared gateway logic | `app/` (never `microservices/`) |
| Alembic migrations | `microservices/<service_name>/migrations/` |
| Integration tests | `tests/integration/` |
| Unit tests | `tests/unit/` |
| OpenAPI contracts | `docs/contracts/<service_name>.yaml` |
| ADRs | `docs/adr/` |

Rules:
- Never place business logic in `app/api/` route handlers — use the service layer.
- Never import from `microservices/*` inside `app/*`.
- Never import from one microservice into another microservice.

### When to write an ADR

Write an ADR in `docs/adr/` when:
- Choosing between two or more viable technical approaches
- Adopting a new library or framework
- Changing a cross-service communication pattern
- Deprecating an existing pattern

ADR filename format: `NNN_short_title.md` (e.g., `003_use_redis_for_session_cache.md`).
Use `docs/architecture/02_adr_001_dependency_rules.md` as a format reference.

## Development Commands

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Run all fitness gates | `make gates` |
| Run tests with current coverage floor | `make test` |
| Lint and format check | `ruff check .` · `ruff format --check .` |
| Type-check enforced CI scope | `mypy --config-file mypy.ini --follow-imports=silent shared/ app/integration/` |
| Validate live documentation | `python scripts/fitness/check_documentation_contract.py` |
| Start full stack | `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d` |
| Start single service | `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up <service_name>` |
| Run migrations | `alembic upgrade head` (run inside the service directory) |

`make gates` is the authoritative local fitness-gate entrypoint. CI also runs contract, test, frontend, image, event-stack, live-E2E, and runtime-truth jobs; no individual local command is a substitute for a failed required job. Mypy is enforced for the scoped paths shown above, not for every file in the repository.

## Git Conventions

### Branch naming

| Type | Pattern |
|------|---------|
| Feature | `feat/<short-description>` |
| Bug fix | `fix/<short-description>` |
| Refactor | `refactor/<short-description>` |
| Docs | `docs/<short-description>` |

### Commit messages

Follow Conventional Commits: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`

```
feat(orchestrator): add retry logic to mission dispatcher
fix(user-service): handle null email on registration
docs(agents): add LangGraph skill trigger rule
```

Rules:
- Subject line ≤ 72 characters, imperative mood
- Body explains *why*, not *what*
- Never commit directly to `main`

### PR descriptions

Lead with what changed and why. Include test evidence (passing CI link or local output). Omit implementation details already visible in the diff.

---

## Inter-Service Communication

All cross-service calls must use `httpx.AsyncClient`. Never instantiate a service class from another service's codebase.

```python
# Correct pattern — always pass X-Correlation-ID
async with httpx.AsyncClient(base_url=settings.ORCHESTRATOR_URL) as client:
    response = await client.post(
        "/missions",
        json=payload,
        headers={"X-Correlation-ID": trace_id},
        timeout=10.0,
    )
    response.raise_for_status()
```

Direct database access across service boundaries is forbidden (Constitution §5).
Use `X-Correlation-ID` on every outbound request for distributed tracing.

---

## Error Handling Contract

*   All HTTP errors must use `fastapi.HTTPException` with a structured `detail` dict:
    ```python
    raise HTTPException(
        status_code=404,
        detail={"code": "RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND", "message": "...", "trace_id": trace_id},
    )
    ```
*   Never let raw Python exceptions propagate to HTTP responses.
*   Log exceptions at `ERROR` level with `trace_id` before raising.
*   Cross-service errors must be re-raised as `HTTPException(502)` with the upstream `trace_id` preserved.

---

## Security Rules

*   Never commit `.env` files, secrets, or API keys.
*   Never log secret values, even at `DEBUG` level.
*   Never print or expose environment variable values in responses or logs.
*   All new endpoints must require authentication unless explicitly marked public in code review.
*   Use `settings` (Pydantic `BaseSettings`) for all configuration — no hard-coded values.
*   Secrets are injected at runtime via environment variables or a secrets manager, never stored in the repository.

---

## Testing

*   **Tests are Specifications:** Write tests that describe *behavior* (what it does), not implementation (how it does it).
*   **Coverage:** the current enforced floor is 73% for the `app/` scope. Full coverage is a long-term target, not a current result; never document it as implemented without a report.
*   Use `pytest-asyncio` with `asyncio_mode = "auto"` (configured in `pytest.ini`).
*   Use `sqlite+aiosqlite:///:memory:` for unit tests; never connect to a real database in unit tests.
*   Override `get_db` via `app.dependency_overrides` for route-level tests.
*   Test file naming: `test_<module_name>.py` mirroring the source tree.
*   Minimum per endpoint: one happy-path test + one error-path test.

**Jules guardrails (`.julesrc`):** The Jules AI agent enforces hard limits per PR:
- Max **5 files created** per PR
- Test coverage minimum: **80%**
- Cyclomatic complexity ≤ **15** per function
- Coverage must not drop more than **1%** per PR

Keep these limits in mind when scoping changes. If a task requires more than 5 new files, split it across multiple PRs.

## Skill Library

To empower agents with specialized expertise, the system includes verified skill modules in `docs/ai_skills/`.

### Skill Trigger Rules

Load the corresponding skill file **before generating any code** in that domain. Read the file each session — do not rely on memory.

| Condition | Load |
|-----------|------|
| Any file under `app/api/` or `microservices/*/src/` | `fastapi-templates.md` |
| Any SQLModel / Alembic / migration work | `database-schema-designer.md` |
| Any file under `app/core/` with CPU/memory concern | `python-performance-optimization.md` |
| Any file under `frontend/` | `vercel-react-best-practices.md` |
| Writing or reviewing a README | `crafting-effective-readmes.md` |
| UI component or CSS work | `web-design-guidelines.md` |
| Any file under `microservices/orchestrator_service/`, `microservices/planning_agent/`, or `microservices/reasoning_agent/` | `langgraph-agent-patterns.md` |
| Any microservice health failure, pipeline_mode≠full, Prometheus target DOWN, or supervisor.sh issue | `microservices-live-verification.md` |
| Any BAC exercise explanation, knowledge_base/ file, exercise_retrieval.py, or student math question | `bac-exercise-explanation.md` |

### Skill Index
