# hardcoded. It previously read `/home/ubuntu/NAAS-Agentic-Core` — an absolute
# path from one developer's machine — so on every other checkout (CI, Codespaces,
# any other clone) the gate reported all four skills and both documents as
# "missing" and exited 1, although every one of them is present and valid.
# A gate that cannot pass anywhere except one laptop enforces nothing; this one
# went unnoticed because it is wired into no workflow. Same derivation as every
